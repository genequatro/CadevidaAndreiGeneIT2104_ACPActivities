# Python Laboratory Activites

## CS 121: Advanced Computer Programming

This readme provides a purpose and an overview and a few instructions that can be used as reviewers in CS 121.

Activities that are shown consists of python conpcepts to enhance and elevate the rate of growth for programming.

#Laboratory Activity 1: Introduction to Python
Item 1: Song Details
- Description: A script to collect and display song details provided by the user.
- Purpose: Demonstrates basic input handling and formatted output.
- Instructions:
   1. The user inputs the year, genre, album, song title, and artist.
   2. The program displays the song details based on the input.
   
Item 2: Character and ASCII Values
- Description: Compares two characters and displays the greater value along with their ASCII values.
- Purpose: Demonstrates string comparison, conditional logic, and the use of ASCII values.
- Instructions:
   1. The user inputs two space-separated characters.
   2.The program determines the character with the greater value and prints their ASCII values.

# Laboratory Activity 2: Libraries and Control Flow
Item 1: Integer Palindrome Checker
- Description: Checks if an integer is a palindrome.
- Purpose: Demonstrates string manipulation and conditional logic.
- Instructions:
   1. The user inputs an integer.
   2. The program checks if it reads the same forward and backward.
   
Item 2: Discount Calculator
- Description: Calculates the final price after applying a discount.
- Purpose: Demonstrates loops, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations.
- Instructions:
   1. The user inputs their total purchase amount.
   2. The program calculates and displays the discount and final price.
   3. The user is asked if they want to perform another transaction.
   
# Laboratory Activity 3: Dictionaries and Lists
Item 1: Roman to Integer
- Description: Converts a Roman numeral to its integer equivalent using a - dictionary.
- Purpose: Demonstrates the use of dictionaries and conditional logic.
- Instructions:
   1.The user enters a Roman numeral (in lowercase or uppercase).
   2.The program processes the numeral to calculate its integer value.
  
Item 2: Perfect Numbers
- Description: Checks if a number is a perfect number.
- Purpose: Demonstrates how to find perfect numbers and handle invalid input.
- Instructions:
   1. The user enters a number.
   2. The program checks if the number is a perfect number and handles errors for invalid inputs.

# Laboratory Activity 4: Object-Oriented Programming
Item 1: Capybara Class
- Description: Defines a Capybara class with attributes for name, gender, and age.
- Purpose: Demonstrates object-oriented programming with classes and instances.
- Instructions:
   1. The user interacts with the program to view and select capybara attributes.
   2. The program displays the selected capybara's attributes based on user input.
   
Item 2: Exception Handling
- Description: Handles errors when retrieving array elements.
- Purpose: Demonstrates array handling, input validation, and exception - - handling.
- Instructions:
   1. The user inputs the size of an array and its elements.
   2. The user specifies an index, and the program prints the element at that index.
Errors like IndexError are handled gracefully.
